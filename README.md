# Advanced Global Coffee Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an advanced analysis of global coffee domestic consumption using Python. It builds upon previous analyses to provide deeper insights into consumption trends, market patterns, and regional differences.

## Key Features
*   **Data Processing**: largely using `pandas` for advanced data manipulation and cleaning of the `Coffee_domestic_consumption.csv` dataset.
*   **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to understand distribution and correlation of coffee consumption.
*   **Visualization**: utilizing `matplotlib` and/or `seaborn` to create compelling visual narratives of the data.
*   **Comparison**: Drawing comparisons with previous findings to highlight evolving trends.

## Technologies Used
*   Python
*   Jupyter Notebook
*   Pandas
*   Matplotlib/Seaborn

## File Structure
*   `Project2_Coffee_Analysis.ipynb`: The primary notebook containing code and analysis.
*   `Project2_Coffee_Analysis.html`: HTML export of the analysis.
*   `Project2_Coffee_Analysis.pdf`: PDF report of the findings.
*   `Coffee_domestic_consumption.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
*   `video_script.md`: Script for the accompanying video presentation.

## Getting Started
1.  Install necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook `Project2_Coffee_Analysis.ipynb`.
3.  Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Note
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of data analysis capabilities using Python, showcasing the transition from raw data to actionable insights.
